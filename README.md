# Yet Another Roguelike

Coded in Python, Yet Another Roguelike is a basic roguelike game where a player traverses through a procedurally generated dungeon, fighting off enemies and finding items to help stave off death. The game ends upon the player's inevitable defeat.

The game is based on the "rogueliketutorials.com" tutorial, and is made using the TCOD library. It can be played through the terminal.

Currently, Yet Another Roguelike features one floor to explore and rats, orcs, and trolls to fight.
